## Overview

A "busy light status" website

It can help your child, loved ones or any member of your team to know what your availability (or mood :)) actually is, especially during this "COVID-19 : work from home" time.

## Information

This project is a website that allows others to view your availability on a "busy light" basis.It is a very simple development for 5 possible states (color and emoji):

- green: Working but AVAILABLE
- blue: QUICK, I'm working
- purple: My BRAIN is at work
- red: I'm on a MEETING
- white: I DO NOT WORK

## Why

With COVID-19, like many, I work from home. It's not easy for all our loved ones to know if and when they can come and talk to us during the day. And, let's face it, whenever they need us, it's during a SUPER IMPORTANT :D meeting. So we had to find a simple, visual and efficient way.

Searching on the web, I found several "devices" that allowed us to give a "light status" based on our availability on "Microsoft Teams" (or any other of the kind).  I also found someone who presented how to build his own system with a raspberry Pi. This is very interesting for a Geek or a "Techno Guy"... And it costs money... Which we have less this time...

Since I had a lot of old (but still "working") and obsolete devices (Windows Surface RT, Android Telephones, etc. ), I thought I could give them a use during this period by using their web browser :)

## How to use it

You can use it in several ways.

- To make it as simple as possible, I published the code under this URL [https://workfromhome.capricehosting.com](https://workfromhome.capricehosting.com) ("http" is also available) and everyone can use it without any problem.
- For those who want a better "control" or even fair changes, you can clone this repo and copy the whole thing to the place you want, as long as it is possible for your web browser to run the html page.

When loading, the status is always "available" (green). You can change your status manually by clicking on the screen and choose one of the 5 statuses.

## Contribution

You can submit problems, questions or even PR, if you want to propose new features ;)

## Donations/Sponsor

If you think this code/project is useful for you, I encourage you to make a donation to a foundation that I hold dear: [The Prader-Willi Syndrome Research Foundation (PWS)](https://www.fpwr.ca/donate/)

Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder, characterized at birth by severe hypotonia, growth disorders, followed by the onset of hyperphagia (i.e. always hungry) during childhood (usually between 2 and 8 years of age), which, without proper management, can lead to the development of morbid obesity.
