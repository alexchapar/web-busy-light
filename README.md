# web-busy-light
A busy light status website

## Informations
This project is a website that can show a busy light "like" status. It could be use on old devices (tant could execute html), publish on a web site or even use this experiment : http://workfromhome.capricehosting.com

It can help your child or any other member of your household or team to know what kind of availability (or mood :)) you are

You can change your status manually with a click on the screen.

## Why
Essentially, I had a lot of old devices and in our house our kids nevers really knew when the could interact with us without disrupting an "important" meeting...

Other "BYO" busylight system need some special skill to built them or you can always by one... This one is really cheap and uses your old (sometimes now useless) devices... :)
