## Information

This project is a website that allows others to see your availability in a "busy light" approach. It is in fact a very simple web development with 5 possible states (color and emoji):

- green: Working but AVAILABLE
- blue: QUICK, I'm working
- purple: My BRAIN is at work
- red: I'm on a MEETING
- white: I DO NOT WORK

## Why

With COVID-19, like many, I work from home. It's not easy for all our relatives to know if they can come and talk to us (or disturb us) during the day. And, let's face it, whenever our loved ones need us, it's during a SUPER IMPORTANT meeting with your Director :scream:. So I had to find a simple, visual and effective way.

Searching on the web, I found several "features" that allowed me to give a "light status" based on my availability based on my status in "Microsoft Teams" (or any other similar tool).  I also found someone who presented how to build his own system with a RaspberryPi. It's very interesting for a Geek or a "Techno Guy"... But it costs money and, for some, we have less these days...

As I had a lot of old obsolete devices (Windows Surface RT, Android phones, etc.) and they were in good shape, I thought I could give them a new use during this period by using their web browser :smirk:

## How to use it

You can use it in several ways:

- To make it as simple as possible, I published the code under this URL [https://workfromhome.capricehosting.com](https://workfromhome.capricehosting.com) (using the "http" protocole is also available :wink:) and everyone can use it without any problem.
- For those of you who want a better "control" or even make modifications, you can clone this repository and copy it to the place you want. The only condition for this to work is that your web browser must be able to run the html page.

When loading, the status will always be "Available" (green). You can change your status manually by clicking on the screen and choosing one of the 5 states.

## Contribution

You can submit issues or even create Pull Request if you want to propose new features :wink:

## Some Thanks

Thank to [OpenMoji](https://openmoji.org/library/#group=smileys-emotion) for the emoji I used and also thank to [Favicon](https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/necktie/)

## Donations/Sponsor

If you think this code/project is useful to you, I encourage you to make a donation to one of these foundations that I hold dear: [Foundation for Prader-Willi Research Canada](https://www.fpwr.ca/donate/) or [International Prader-Willi Syndrome Organisation](https://ipwso.org/make-a-donation/)

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized at birth by severe hypotonia, growth disorders, learning disabilities and the appearance of hyperphagia (i.e. always being hungry) during childhood (usually appears between 2 and 8 years of age). Without adequate care (and sometimes despite care) this can lead to the development of morbid obesity. You can learn more about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prader%E2%80%93Willi_syndrome), on the [Foundation for Prader-Willi Research](https://www.fpwr.org/) website or on the [International Prader-Willi Syndrome Organisation](https://ipwso.org/) website.
